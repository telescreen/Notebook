```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


For this demo, we create a narrower dataset to see the results of joins

```{r}
library(nycflights)
flights2 <- flights %>%
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
```

Want to add full airline name to the `flights2`

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```


```{r}
arr_avg_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(arr_avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T))

airports %>%
  semi_join(arr_avg_delay, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color=arr_avg_delay)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()
```
